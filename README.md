Pet-Store Web API

Created using Spring Boot in Eclipse, honing skills for JPA, Maven, JSON, Java, and SQL.
Run 'PetStoreApplication.java to create tables in pet-store schema.

Application will create four tables: pet-store, customer, employee, and a pet-store-customer join table. It will eventually use ARC to populate the tables with data.
